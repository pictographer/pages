# Tagged Base64

I wrote the [Tagged Base64 Rust
crate](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/tagged-base64).

[Tagged Base64
Converter](https://pictographer.github.io/tb64-converter) is a web
interface to demonstrate conversion of text to and from TaggedBase64
format. The web interface works locally. I haven't yet figured out Git Hub Pages
workflow for wasm yet. You can see the [not-currently-functional
interface](https://pictographer.github.io/tb64-converter/www).

You can build and run the interface by following the instructions in the README in the [Tagged Base64 Converter repository](https://github.com/pictographer/tb64-converter/).
