# My Resume and Portfolio

I'm figuring out GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and wasm on pages.

This is my latest attempt at a more modern static website. There's
another attempt for my user and yet another attempt as part of the
Tagged Base64 web interface. Eventually, this repo's contents should
move to the user pages repo and the Tagged Base64 web interface should
be included.
