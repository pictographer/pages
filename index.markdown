The Pictographer's Shop is the virutal workshop of John
D. Corbett. I’m primarily a software developer, but I have several
professional interests adjacent to software development including
graphic arts, marketing, management, electronics, and technical
writing.

Early in my career, I was drawn to the most exciting technology and
didn't think too much about other aspects of the workplace such as
company culture or work practices, with the exception of skill
acquisition. I'm still driven to make things work, but I recognize
that the collaborators are more important than the domain. I’m
interested in finding people to work with whose values align with
mine.

Briefly,

- We seek work that is beneficial, not merely lucrative
- We choose correctness over haste

I'm seeking a software development position in any of the following

- Engineering
- Science
- Architecture
- Education
- Design

Preferably in Rust, ideally open source, but I'm open to various tool
stacks and business models.

I'm happy to lead a team and mentor co-workers. Although I've had some
proud successes as a manager, I'm still new at it.

I've got a high tolerance for working without interaction, but I
prefer to have at least one active collaborator and leadership willing
and able to provide meaningful guidance.

I have a solid track record as a creative software developer. I have
ten patents, including one foundational patent in user interface
development and a pretty wild patent for verifying integrated circuits
using their electromagnetic emanations. My verbal skills enable me to
facilitate creative conversations. I've often been the originator of
new applications and libraries.
